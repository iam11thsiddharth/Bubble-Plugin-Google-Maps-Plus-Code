If you want to be able to:\n\nsearch by address,\nsearch by short codes with localities,\nor have short codes and localities included in responses\nyou must provide a Google API key in your request. To obtain a Google API key refer here.\n\nImportant:\n\nThe API key must have the Google Maps Geocoding API enabled\nThe API key must not have any restrictions (referrer, IP address). (This is because it is used to call the web service API, which does not allow restrictions on the key.)\nOnce you have your API key, you can specify it in requests using the key parameter"
